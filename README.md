# jekyll-sitebuilder
A docker container based on alpine and jekyll intended to programmatically build jekyll-generated content as a command line application.

## Status

This is currently under heavy development, although just started working for me.

## What does it do

You have that desktop / server / device that don't want to install Jekyll (or are unable to install and maintain a sane installation) and need to maintain Jekyll content, like a website or a blog.

This aims to be a docker-as-an-application cli util, able to build your content and output HTML and assets without messing with your host operating system.

## Credits

This work is based on [Irakli Nadareishvili](https://github.com/inadarei)'s [alpine-jekyll](https://github.com/inadarei/alpine-jekyll).
